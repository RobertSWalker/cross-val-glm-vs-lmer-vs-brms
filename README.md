# cross-val-glm-vs-lmer-vs-brms
Repeated k-fold cross validation functions in R evaluate glm (linear) versus lmer (mixed) versus brms (bayesian) models.

Repeated k-fold cross validation is a natural method for comparing across different statistical methods. Here a repeated cross validation R-sq allows the user to evaluate amongst glm, lmer, and brms models.
